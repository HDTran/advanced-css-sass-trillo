# Trillo Hotel Page Mockup
Trillo hotel page mockup project using Flexbox and other CSS3 techniques for the Advanced CSS &amp; SASS course taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.

# Starting the Project
To install dependencies and start the project, execute the following:
```sh
npm install 
npm run start
```

# Building the Project
To build the CSS file (compiling the SASS/SCSS files, prefixing it for browser support, and finally compressing it), execute the following:
```sh
npm run build:css
```

# Important
Some of the CSS techniques will not work unless it is being served from an actual server, so starting the project through ```npm run start``` is advised.
